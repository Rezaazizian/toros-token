# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please create a Private Security Advisory in GitHub (Repository  Security  Advisories  "Report a vulnerability").
- If you cannot use advisories, open a private email channel and share minimal reproduction details. Do not file a public issue for sensitive reports.

## Response Timeline
- Acknowledgment: within 72 hours
- Initial assessment: within 5 business days
- Fix window: target 14 days for high/critical issues; may vary based on impact and complexity
- Credit: we will credit reporters upon request after a fix is released

## Scope
- Code in this repository (`trs-dapp/`, `trs-meta/`, `toros-solana/`, configs)
- Devnet deployments and documentation linked from this repo

## Out of Scope
- Phishing/social engineering, thirdparty service outages, DoS without a clear software bug, vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies we do not control

## Safe Harbor
We will not pursue or support legal action for goodfaith, nondestructive security research that respects privacy and makes a best effort to avoid service disruption and data exfiltration.
